<h1>Graphic Design as a Liberal Art</h1>
<h3>
  The Curious
</h3>
<p1> <em>"the teaching of art is the teaching of all things."-John Ruskin</em></p1>

  The graphic design field is awash with contradictions. it sits in the awkward cross-section between service and craft. it's at once a service given to others and a craft we hone for ourselves it can be both invisible and influential, somtimes showing a point of view and other times remaining apathetic to its content.
</p>
<p>
  But graphic design is rarely about itself;it's a language, a vessel in which we can fill whatever we'd like. Sometimes it's filled by clients and sometimes we fill it with ourselves, but it's always a vehicle for communication. In his 1994 essay, Design Education as a Liberal Art, Gunnar Swanson writes:
</p>
<p><em> Design does not have a subject matter of its own-it exists in practice only in relation to the requirements of given projects. the path of progress for the field is not defined by the next great unsolved design problems. Design is integrative in that, by its lack of specific subject matter, it has the potential to connect many disciplines.
</em></p>
<p>
  And perhaps thats what makes graphic design such an inspiring and exciting field. As a designer, one is consistently introduced to new subject matters- new worlds-that one must then turn around and share that knowledge in a simple, smart, and aesthetically pleasing manner. I've often compared graphic design to journalismdigging deep into a particular topic, becoming invested in it, and then returning to share what's been learned. Graphic design provides a catalyst for connecting ideas. An integral part of being a designer is learning a lot about a lot of different fields.
</p>
<p>
  Swanson posits that studying graphic design offers something to those outside the field:
</p>
<p><em>
  Can studying design be of general, not just professional, interest? Can the study of design inform other areas of study? We assume that a design student would benefit from studying anthropology; we need to consider whether an anthropology student would benefit from the study of graphic design. Do we really have anything to offer outside of the sometimes questionable promise of a job?
